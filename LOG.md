## Day 4
- **Did:** Built auth on `feature/auth` (uncommitted): `User` model + migration `0001`, register/login/me, `get_current_user` and `require_role`, Argon2 (pwdlib) + PyJWT (30 min), generic login errors, SECRET_KEY startup guard (fails closed unless ENVIRONMENT is local/test), CORS allow-list validation. Security, DB and code reviews run and their fixes applied. 36 tests written.
- **Learned:** Two Postgres servers listen on port 5432 here (a native Windows service and the Docker `db` container), so `localhost` reaches the wrong one and fails password auth.
- **Stuck on:** 26 DB-backed tests can't run yet (10 non-DB tests pass). Migration `0001` not yet run against a real DB.
- **Next:** Resolve the port clash, run the full suite, add a migration-vs-models test, add login/register rate limiting (Redis) before deploy, then commit.
